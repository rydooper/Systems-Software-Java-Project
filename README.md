# Systems-Software-Project
Repository for all the code and files related to our Year 2 Systems Software Module Project (2020-21). This program is a client-server based Java application, with each user client on a different thread. Once logged in, the user - a farmer - can access data about their field, the weather station data from within their field and, if they are an admin, all the users registered to the program.

This is the final program that our group made! :)
Group members were: Ryder Franklin (me), Niveetha Sivaruban, Luke Aldred and Alexander Burke.
